# spawn
A video game like NeoQuest but with a twist


The idea behind this game is that it should be very much like neoquest - they player character gains exp for fighting monsters, you get skill points and a similar skill tree setup to Neoquest (health/def buffs, strength buffs, stuns = frost damage, fire damage, poison damage).

However, the conciet is that you aren't on your own fighting the monsters. There's other people continuously leaving the town to ALSO fight monsters. And these are group battles (still turn based, but groups). 

So while you CAN get through the game just increasing your damage & killing everything, it's much better to help out your friends.

Then, it turns out that the monsters are also fighting each other (think fanged rabbits vs minor forest wolves). And you can help out some monsters against others. The game should end up consisting of strengthening certain species of monsters against other species, so that you can progress. Eg maybe you strength buff the bunnies and they overpower the wolves. 

At the highest level, this might turn into conway's game of life - make patterns of bunnies into a glider form so they go kill the boss for you, or something.

There should be different map tiles (desert, plains) and different kinds of monsters spawn on them. Eventually monsters should grow into a kind of stable state in each area - one population overpowers another, and they're essentially spawn camping. So it's your job to come in and sway the balance in the direction that most helps you.

Monsters, and the buffs / changes you make to them, should persist. That's how you can affect the population.



# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
